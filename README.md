# Project: [automationexercise.com](https://github.com/rasme54/automationexercise.com/tree/master)

###  Main Goal:
The goal of the project is to create automated tests for the **automationexercise.com** application using **Cypress 9.5.1**. The main objective is to gain practical experience in end-to-end testing by implementing documented test cases. In the future, I plan to work on separate branches within the **Git** repository, which will allow me to experiment easily and potentially update the written Cypress tests to newer versions.

### Technologies: 
 - Javascript,
 - Cypress --v9.5.1
	 - "cypress-real-events" v1.14.0
	 - "cypress-file-upload" v5.0.8
 - node.js-- v20.11.1
